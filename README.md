This project examines workplace factors affecting employee well-being, burnout, job satisfaction, and turnover rates using data analysis. It explores mental health scores, burnout levels across departments, turnover causes, the impact of Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), and the link between stress and quitting. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis includes visualizations like heatmaps and boxplots. Findings show that high stress and burnout increase turnover, while job satisfaction helps retention. The project is open-source under the MIT License and welcomes contributions for improvements.
