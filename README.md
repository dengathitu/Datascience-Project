# Employee Well-being & Turnover Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes workplace factors affecting employee well-being, job satisfaction, burnout, and turnover rates. Using data-driven insights, we aim to identify key trends and recommend strategies to improve employee retention and productivity.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various workplace factors such as:
- **Job Satisfaction**
- **Burnout Frequency**
- **Stress Levels**
- **Mental Health Absences**
- **Turnover Intention**
- **Department & Workplace Conditions**

## Key Business Questions
1. **What is the distribution of mental health scores among employees?**  
   - Helps identify employees at risk and guide mental health support programs.

2. **Are there significant differences in burnout levels across departments?**  
   - Identifies high-burnout departments to improve workload balance and retention.

3. **What factors contribute to high turnover rates?**  
   - Helps in reducing turnover by addressing workplace issues and improving job satisfaction.

4. **How does access to Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) impact burnout levels?**  
   - Determines if EAPs improve employee well-being.

5. **Do employees experiencing high stress levels have a higher turnover intention?**  
   - Examines whether with high stress levels tend to quit

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization (Heatmaps, Boxplots, Histograms, Countplots)**
